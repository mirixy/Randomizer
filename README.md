# Randomizer
Randomize Items of an Array (In this case Names) and displays it in a GUI 

This is a project just for fun. Some classmates made different radomizers in other languages, so I thought, I would try it in Java. 
The Project will get more features when I am ready to implement them. 

For now all it can do is display a random name from an array. That is the main function our teacher needed anyway. But I want to be able to edit the list or provide a text file and read it line by line into an array.
